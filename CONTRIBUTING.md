## Contributing to Trood Core

Thank you for contributing to Trood Core!

All of the necessary information can be found in our [code of conduct](https://www.notion.so/trood/Trood-Testament-4a08910e65c04cf39253d0fb8f06ef59) as well as in [GitHub discussions](https://github.com/orgs/TroodInc/discussions).

### Proposing changes

The best way to propose a change is to start a discussion on our GitHub repository.

- First, write a short problem statement, which clearly and briefly describes the problem you want to solve independently from any specific solution. It doesn't need to be long or formal, but it's difficult to consider a solution in absence of a clear understanding of the problem.

- Next, write a short solution proposal. How can the problem (or set of problems) you have stated above be addressed? What are the pros and cons of your approach? Again, keep it brief and informal. This isn't a specification, but rather a starting point for a conversation.

- By effectively engaging with the our team and community early in your process, we're better positioned to give you feedback and understand your pull request once you open it. If the first thing we see from you is a big changeset, we're much less likely to respond to it in a timely manner.
