# Trood Product Roadmap

This document outlines the key milestones and development stages for the **Trood Product**. Our vision is to revolutionize software development through an AI-powered technical director that automates key stages of product development, from market research to deployment.

## 🎯 **Vision**
To create an AI-powered development platform where users can describe an idea and have Trood automatically generate and deploy a complete, functional software solution by assembling modular components.

---

## 🛣️ **Roadmap Overview**

We are building the product in **four major stages**, with increasing AI involvement at each phase. The end goal is a fully automated AI-driven development experience.

---

## **Stage 1: Foundation (Completed)**

### Key Focus:
- Establish the core infrastructure for collecting and organizing open-source solutions.
- Develop key modules for rapid application development.


---

## **Stage 2: Community & Metadata Labeling (Ongoing)**

### Key Focus:
- Expand the repository through community contributions and curate solutions with metadata for easy retrieval and future AI training.

### Milestones:
- 🟡 **Community engagement**: Invite developers to contribute libraries and projects.
- 🟡 **Metadata tagging system**: Define and implement metadata standards for repositories.
- 🟡 **Automated indexing**: Automate the process of categorizing new submissions.
- 🟡 **AI metadata labeling**: Start using AI to label code modules based on functionality.
- 🟡 **UI Builder**: Initiate a modular UI-building system.
- 🟡 **Automated Security Analysis**: Deploy automated tools to analyze and secure repositories.

---

## **Stage 3: AI-Driven Orchestration (Planned)**

### Key Focus:
- Enable AI agents to search and retrieve relevant code modules for assembly based on user requirements.

### Milestones:
- 🔵 **AI-powered search and recommendation**: Develop an AI system to recommend code modules.
- 🔵 **Dynamic UI builder**: Automatically generate user interfaces based on retrieved modules.
- 🔵 **AI agents for process orchestration**: Build an AI agent that coordinates backend services and APIs.
- 🔵 **AI agents for Business Data Orchestration**: Implement agents to handle and organize business-critical data workflows.
- 🔵 **AI agents for Data Orchestration**: Manage and orchestrate data flows across services.
- 🔵 **Blockchain Code Licensing**: Introduce automated blockchain-based licensing and contributor payout systems.

## **Stage 4: Fully Automated AI Development (Future)**

### Key Focus:
- Enable end-to-end software creation with minimal human intervention, allowing users to describe their idea and let AI build the entire product.

### Milestones:
- 🔴 **AI-driven development assistant**: Let users input product descriptions and have AI assemble and deploy the software.
- 🔴 **One-click deployment**: Streamline deployment pipelines.
- 🔴 **Human-business interface**: Provide an intuitive UI where users interact with AI to refine requirements.
- 🔴 **AI DevOps**: Automate CI/CD pipelines for continuous testing, integration, and deployment.
- 🔴 **AI BPM (Business Process Management)**: AI-powered orchestration for managing complex workflows.
- 🔴 **AI CSO (Chief Security Officer)**: Advanced AI-based security and risk management.
- 🔴 **AI Community/Talent Manager**: Manage human workflows and collaborations through AI-powered community orchestration.
- 🔴 **Human-readable Smart Service Agreements**: Blockchain-based contracts for contributors and users.
