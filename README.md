## 📌 Repository Roadmap
Unlike our [Trood Product Roadmap](ROADMAP.md), which focuses on end-user solutions, this roadmap details **how this metarepository will evolve** and what developers can do to contribute.

### **Phase 1: Foundation (Current Stage)**
✅ Establish core structure with categorized repositories  
✅ Reformant and add solutions of Trood Development Team to the Metarepository\n
✅ Collect and organize high-quality existing solutions  
 

### **Phase 2: Community & Expansion**
🟡 Expand the repository with contributions from external developers  
🟡 Develop a rating/review system for contributed solutions
🟡 Build an automated indexing and metadata system   
🟡 Integrate CI/CD to validate new contributions automatically  

### **Phase 3: AI-Driven Code Retrieval**
🔵 Implement AI-powered code search & recommendation engine  
🔵 Develop APIs for programmatic access to the metarepository  
🔵 Train AI models on structured solutions for code assembly  

### **Phase 4: Fully Automated AI Development**
🔴 Enable AI-driven software development using repository assets  
🔴 Create an intelligent agent that assembles software autonomously  
🔴 Provide end-to-end development automation for businesses
